# SkillUp-AI-Guided-Learning-Roadmaps-for-Early-Professionals
**Overview**
This repository contains a product strategy and MVP design slide deck for SkillUp, a 0→1 AI-powered upskilling product concept built to help early-career professionals confidently decide what skill to learn next and take the first meaningful step toward career growth.
The slide deck demonstrates end-to-end product management thinking, from problem discovery and user research to MVP prioritization, user journey design, metrics definition, monetization, and distribution strategy.

**Problem Context**
The internet offers unlimited learning content, yet early-career professionals struggle with:
Overwhelming choice across courses and platforms
Unclear career ROI of skills
Fear of wasting time or money
Low completion rates and frequent drop-offs
The core problem is not lack of content, but lack of clarity, confidence, and commitment.

**Target User**
Students and early-career professionals (0–3 years experience)
Actively seeking career growth or role transitions
Limited time and attention
Outcome-oriented and portfolio-driven
High risk of research paralysis and learning fatigue

**Product Hypothesis**
If early-career professionals are given:
Personalized, career-aligned skill roadmaps
Short, structured micro-learning modules
Industry-relevant portfolio projects
Clear progress tracking and milestones
Then learning becomes more confident, actionable, and sustainable, leading to higher activation, completion, and retention.
**MVP Scope**
The slide deck prioritizes a focused MVP with:
AI-generated personalized skill roadmaps
Bite-sized learning tasks optimized for low attention spans
Project-based learning aligned to real hiring signals
Progress tracking to reinforce commitment
Mentorship, certifications, and advanced coaching are intentionally deferred post-MVP.
